        description: "The Basilica of Our Lady of Peace (French: Basilique Notre-Dame de la Paix) is a Catholic minor basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro, the administrative capital of CÃ´te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). Guinness World Records lists it as the largest church in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, Saint Peter's Basilica. It has an area of 30,000 square metres (320,000 sq ft)[2] and is 158 metres (518 ft) high.[3] However, it also includes a rectory and a villa (counted in the overall area), which are not strictly part of the church. It can accommodate 18,000 worshippers, compared to 60,000 for St. Peter's.",

        description: "At 5,895 m, Kilimanjaro is the highest point in Africa. This volcanic massif stands in splendid isolation above the surrounding plains, with its snowy peak looming over the savannah. The mountain is encircled by mountain forest. Numerous mammals, many of them endangered species, live in the park. In 1973, the mountain and its six surrounding forest corridors were named Kilimanjaro National Park in order to protect its unique environment. The park was named a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage site in 1987.",

        description: "The large Afro-Brazilian religious building, the central mosque is located in the main market of the city of Porto-Novo. This mosque, built at the beginning of the 20th century, was built by freed slaves who were influenced by the baroque architecture of the cathedral of the city of Salvador de Bahia in Brazil. The only significant difference between this mosque and Bahia Cathedral is the presence of the crescent at the place where there is a cross on the church. The construction of this building began in 1910 and ended in 1936.",
